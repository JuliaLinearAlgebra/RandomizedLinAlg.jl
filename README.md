RandomizedLinAlg.jl is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package that provides randomized algorithms for numerical linear algebra as advocated in [1].

This package was split off from [IterativeSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl) as randomized algorithms were not considered well-established and potentially unstable.

See the [**manual**](https://haampie.github.io/RandomizedLinAlg.jl/latest/) for the available methods.
